              I am a dedicated Computer Science graduate from the University of
              Malawi with a strong passion for technology and problem-solving.
              Throughout my studies and practical experiences, I have developed
              skills in web and mobile app development, UI/UX design, and
              graphic design. Iâ€™ve led projects, collaborated with teams, and
              participated in various community and professional roles. I am
              eager to apply my knowledge and continue growing as a software
              developer.
